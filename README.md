### Hi there 👋

**My name is Sam, just under four months ago, I began my journey into tech - via the School of Code bootcamp 🚀**

- 🔭 I started my journey working on some simple web-design projects following a UI course on Udemy
- 🌱 As well as learning HTML, CSS and Javascript on FreeCodeCamp. and will be learning more in the School of Code Bootcamp!
- 🎮 I have some experience in videogame design within unreal engine, I created two games from scratch on UE4 and created all sounds to match!
- 🏃🚲🏊‍♂️ My non-coding life consists of training for my first triathlon - which is on the 16th July 2023! 🏃🚲🏊‍♂️
- ⚽️ I also love football (As a CFC fan), but love to play too!
- 👨‍🍳 I'm a big fan of cooking, and spent a short time as a chef!
- 🥾 Finally, I love hiking, exploring and resting in nature - breaking away from a digital-dominated life regularly, is important to me.
